Some preprocessing tools for real-world head coordinates from a 3D electromagnetic digitizer for functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), but could also be used for electroencephalography (EEG) or any other landmark-based neuroimaging method. There is also some embedded use of SPM and the NFRI Toolbox for some basic visualization of function mapped to these spatial estimates, including some measures for quality control.
